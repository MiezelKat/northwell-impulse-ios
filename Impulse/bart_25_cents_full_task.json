To collect your money for each balloon, hit the collect button. But remember, the more you pump the balloon, the greater chance of it bursting. The max amount you can win per balloon is $2.50. When it bursts, you get no money for that balloon. Your goal is to earn as much possible over the 15 balloons.",
